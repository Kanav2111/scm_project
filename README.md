# Music Player Made Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python

## Introduction

Welcome to our collaborative project: the Music Player Made Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. Crafted by our dynamic team consisting of Jatin Bhardwaj, Jivansh Midha, and Kanav Kumar, our project aims to deliver an immersive and visually appealing music playback experience while showcasing the power of web development combined with Python backend.

In an era where music is an integral part of our lives, our goal is to provide a platform that not only plays your favorite tunes but also serves as a testament to the possibilities of web design, development, and backend integration.

As we believe that music has the power to change the world and touch people's lives, we emphasize the importance of creating a beautiful masterpiece in both design and functionality. Whether you're feeling happy, sad, or simply alone, music has the ability to uplift your spirits and make you feel better.
